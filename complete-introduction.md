## **PART 2: EXTENDED INTRODUCTION (2-3 MINUTES)**

### **When they ask: "Walk me through your background"**

**YOUR ANSWER:**

"I'm Aman Raj, a Senior Java Backend Developer based in India with 3+ years of professional experience in the fintech domain.

**My Journey:**

I started my career at [Previous Company], where I built banking applications with OAuth and Spring Security. That foundation taught me the importance of security-first design, which became invaluable in my later work.

**Current Role - Recon Engine (2+ years):**

I'm currently working on a **Reconciliation Engine** at [Current Company] - one of the most challenging projects I've been part of. Here's what makes it special:

*The Challenge:* Match 10 million financial transactions daily from multiple sources (Charles River, Aladdin, Internal Systems) with 99.9% accuracy.

*The Solution:* I designed a microservices architecture with:
- Kafka for event streaming and load leveling
- Parallel Java streams for 400 TPS (transactions per second) processing
- Oracle partitioning and indexing for query optimization
- IBM MQ with SSL/TLS for secure messaging
- Redis caching for reference data
- Kubernetes for orchestration with auto-scaling

*The Impact:*
- Processing time: 12 hours → 7 hours (42% improvement)
- Throughput: 230 TPS → 400 TPS (40% increase)
- Latency: 500ms per transaction → 325ms (35% reduction)
- Infrastructure savings: 67% (15 servers → 5 servers)

The technical depth here was immense - I had to master:
- JVM tuning (G1GC, heap sizing, GC pauses)
- Database optimization (partitioning, indexing, query plans)
- Distributed systems (CAP theorem, eventual consistency, circuit breakers)
- Message queuing (IBM MQ channels, SSL configuration, idempotency)

**CRTS Project - Charles River Integration (1 year concurrent):**

In parallel, I led the integration with Charles River Trading System (CRTS) and BlackRock Aladdin:
- Designed APIs for trade allocation and settlement
- Implemented HTTP/2 client for 60% latency reduction on external calls
- Built sealed classes and records (Java 17) for type-safe message routing
- Setup end-to-end SSL/TLS with mutual authentication
- Achieved 99.95% uptime despite occasional downstream service failures using circuit breakers

This taught me the importance of:
- Defensive programming (circuit breakers, fallbacks, retries)
- Security by design (SSL/TLS, certificate management)
- Operational readiness (monitoring, alerting, runbooks)

**OPS Portal - Leadership Experience (6 months):**

Built a unified operational dashboard (Angular 20 + .NET Core) that integrated 15+ backend microservices. This was my first experience across full stack:
- Designed REST APIs from scratch
- Learned Angular RxJS and reactive forms
- Built .NET controllers with dependency injection
- Implemented responsive UI for operational teams

This project taught me:
- Cross-functional collaboration
- API contract design
- Frontend performance considerations (lazy loading, change detection)
- Importance of user feedback in UI/UX

**Technical Depth:**

Over 3 years, I've gone deep on:
- **Java 8-21:** Streams, lambdas, CompletableFuture, optional, sealed classes, records, pattern matching, virtual threads
- **Spring Boot:** Auto-configuration, microservices patterns, REST APIs, security, actuator
- **System Design:** CAP theorem, distributed caching, event-driven architecture, CQRS, saga pattern
- **Database:** Oracle query optimization, partitioning, indexing, transaction management
- **Messaging:** IBM MQ, Kafka, SSL/TLS configuration, idempotency patterns
- **Cloud & DevOps:** Docker multi-stage builds, Kubernetes deployments, Jenkins CI/CD, AWS basics
- **Fintech:** Trade reconciliation, settlement systems, payment processing, regulatory compliance

**Why Remote Work:**

For the past 2+ years, I've been working remotely by necessity due to my parents' health situation. Initially, I was concerned about productivity and collaboration. Instead, I've proven that I'm **equally or more productive remotely**:
- Met every deadline without exception
- Delivered 35% latency improvements while remote
- Led technical discussions across time zones
- Mentored junior developers in the team
- Maintained 99.9% uptime despite being distributed

This experience taught me the value of:
- Asynchronous communication
- Over-communication in remote settings
- Setting clear boundaries between work and family care
- Discipline in self-management

**What I'm Looking For:**

I'm seeking a remote backend role at a top fintech company where I can:
1. Scale distributed systems to handle billions of transactions
2. Continue learning cutting-edge technologies (Project Loom virtual threads, reactive frameworks)

3. Speed: Complete in < 8 hours for morning reports
4. Reliability: Zero data loss, 99.9% uptime required

**Architecture Design (My Responsibility):**

I designed a multi-tier system:

**Tier 1 - Ingestion:**
- Built Kafka consumers to ingest from Charles River, Aladdin
- Implemented validation and transformation
- Decouple input speed from processing speed

**Tier 2 - Processing:**
- Partition transactions by account (sharding key)
- Apply matching algorithms in parallel
- Use circuit breaker for external API calls
- Implement idempotency for message deduplication

**Tier 3 - Storage:**
- Oracle with daily partitioning (each day = separate partition)
- Redis for caching reference data
- Audit trail for compliance

**Tier 4 - Reporting:**
- REST API for daily reports
- Real-time metrics dashboard
- Exception handling UI for manual review

**Optimization Work:**

1. **Java Optimization:**

**Challenge:** "Initial analysis showed bottleneck was not application logic but JVM garbage collection - full GC pauses were taking 800ms each."

**Action:** 
"I took systematic approach:
1. Analyzed GC logs and saw 50+ full GCs during batch
2. Migrated to Java 17 and G1GC from ParallelGC
3. Tuned heap from 4GB to 8GB (matching server capacity)
4. Set MaxGCPauseMillis=200ms
5. Verified with JProfiler"

**Result:** "Latency dropped from 500ms to 325ms - 35% improvement. Processing time went from 12 hours to 7 hours."

**Why I Tell This:** Shows I can identify bottlenecks, use profiling tools, understand JVM internals, and deliver measurable improvement.

---

### **Story 2: The SSL Implementation (Security + Leadership)**

**Setup:** "Our CRTS integration needed 100% secure communication with Charles River and Aladdin - sensitive trade data."

**Challenge:** "SSL/TLS configuration is complex. Wrong cipher suite = security breach. Certificate management is operationally hard."

**Action:**
"I:
1. Researched fintech security requirements and best practices
2. Designed end-to-end SSL with mutual authentication
3. Created key repositories and certificate management automation
4. Built certificate rotation scripts (automated 30-day renewal)
5. Documented runbooks for ops team
6. Tested failure scenarios (expired certs, wrong certs)"

---

## **PART 6: HANDLING FOLLOW-UP QUESTIONS**

### **"Why are you looking for a change?"**

**YOUR ANSWER:**

"I've had a tremendous experience at my current company. I've built production systems, learned immensely, and delivered measurable impact. At this point in my career, I'm looking for:

1. **New Technical Challenges:** I've optimized the Recon Engine significantly. Now I want to tackle new hard problems - maybe building real-time trading systems, or scaling to 100M+ transactions.

2. **Remote Work Commitment:** I need a fully remote role because my parents require my care due to health reasons. My current company has been flexible, but I want to be sure my next role is 100% remote without question.

3. **Growth Opportunities:** I want to work with senior engineers and tackle larger-scale challenges. Your company's focus on [specific area] aligns perfectly with my interests.

I'm seeking a long-term role where I can contribute meaningfully, continue learning, and have stability for my family situation."

---

### **"Why this specific company?"**

**YOUR ANSWER:**

"I've researched your company and three things stand out:

1. **Technical Excellence:** Your engineering culture around [specific technology/practice] aligns with my values. Your recent [specific project/blog post] showed how you tackle [specific challenge].

3. **Remote-First:** Your committed remote policy is crucial for me due to family health considerations. I've proven remote delivery, and your company's distributed culture makes sense for how I work best.

Specifically, I'm excited about [mention specific technology or challenge they're solving] and believe my experience with [relevant achievement] positions me well to contribute immediately."

---

### **"What is your biggest weakness?"**

**YOUR ANSWER:**

"My biggest weakness is that I sometimes over-engineer solutions initially. For example, when designing the Recon Engine, I spent extra time designing for 100M transactions/day when we only needed 10M.

How I've addressed it:
1. **Get requirements first** - Now I start with "what problem are we solving NOW, not in 5 years?"
2. **Measure before optimizing** - Use profiling and data, not assumptions
3. **YAGNI principle** - You Aren't Gonna Need It. Build for today, refactor tomorrow if needed

This weakness actually turned into a strength - I learned to balance perfectionism with pragmatism. For CRTS integration, I initially designed an elaborate retry mechanism but after discussing with the team, realized 3 retries was sufficient. This pragmatism helped us ship 2 weeks earlier."
